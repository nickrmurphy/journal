# Journal by Early Bird

A local-first, simple journaling app for daily notes that encourages authentic self-expression.

## Why Journal?

Traditional digital journals make it too easy to self-censor: deleting, editing, and overthinking what you've written. Journal takes inspiration from pen and paper: **each entry, is a snapshot in time**. This encourages honest, unfiltered thoughts without the temptation to perfect or sanitize your authentic voice.

Instead of editing entries, you can reflect on them later by adding comments, creating a natural progression of thoughts over time.

## Features

- **Daily Notes**: Simple, focused journaling for daily reflection
- **Immutable Entries**: Entries can't be edited once created to prevent self-censorship
- **Reflective Comments**: Add comments to entries for later thoughts and insights
- **Local-First**: All data stored in your browser‚Äîno servers, no accounts, complete privacy
- **Data Export**: Export your journal data as JSON
- **P2P Sync** *(Coming Soon)*: End-to-end encrypted sync between your devices via WebRTC

## Privacy & Data

Your journal data lives **only in your browser**. No servers store your personal thoughts. When P2P sync launches, data will be encrypted end-to-end and transmitted directly between your devices‚Äînever touching our servers.

## Availability

Born out of a personal need for simple and private journaling, Journal by Early Bird will be enhanced and available for public use by the new year.
